Eutrobot – Tackling Eutrophication and Water Contamination

Purpose: Designed to address the critical environmental issues of eutrophication and water contamination in freshwater ecosystems like rivers, lakes, and ponds.

AI-Powered Innovation:
 Eutrobot is the world’s first AI-powered phytoremediation robot integrating Robotics, IoT, AI, and Nature for water purification.

Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring:
 Equipped with pH, TDS, and Turbidity sensors, providing continuous real-time insights on water health.

Autonomous Navigation & Detection:
 Features an AI Computer Vision camera for algal bloom detection, enabling the robot to autonomously navigate and identify pollution hotspots.

Smart Phytoremediation Deployment:
 Automatically dispenses a biochemical phytoremediation solution when contamination is detected

Phytoremediation Solution Composition:
 Contains aquatic plants such as Lemna minor and Chlorella vulgaris, known for absorbing nutrients (N, P) and heavy metals (like lead, arsenic, mercury, etc.).

Environmental Restoration:
 The biological agents neutralize pollutants, helping restore aquatic biodiversity, improve water clarity, and reduce diseases linked to contaminated water (e.g., cholera, dysentery).
Ground Station Support:
 A shore-based recharging and refueling station provides phytosolution replenishment and power for uninterrupted operation.
